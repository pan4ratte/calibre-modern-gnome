# Calibre Modern GNOME

This is a Calibre icon theme, a modern and a clean one. All themes, that are currently alailable in Calibre icon store, are morally deprecated and should be replaced with some modern alternative. This is that alternative.


## Key Principles

1. Use modern Ubuntu GNOME icons as much as it is possible, particulary Yaru-Blue version. I really like GNOME iteration of Ununtu Linux and try to implement their icons in Calibre interface. That means that if there is a good Ubuntu GNOME icon for a certain UI element in Calibre, it should be prioritesed for implementation. Yaru-Blue is my choice beacue blue color feels more calming than other once if we speake of what is available in Yaru.

2. If there is no Ununtu GNOME icon that fits, use suitable icons from other themes available in the Calibre icon store. Some of these themes use good icons for certain UI elements while not conflicting with modern GNOME style. If there is no suitable GNOME icon, you should try to find one in other themes. The key rquirement is to avoid style conflicts with Yaru-Blue.

3. Use any other suitable open-source icons that do not conflict stylistically with modern GNOME icons. Sometimes there is no good icon for certain UI element in either Yaru-Blue or Calibre icon themes. In that case you should try to find a good open-source (or free for non-commercial use) icon alternative.
